# Sources

Ghost Town is a picture of downtown Bushnell, McDonough County, Illinois, about 1880. The streets and the railroad are taken from the old plat and from maps. Named buildings are taken from the county histories and the 1954 centennial book. Everything else is marked `inferred` in `public/data/bushnell-1880.json`.

Distances in the model are in feet. The origin is the middle of Hail Street on the centerline of the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy tracks. Positive x runs northeast along those tracks. Positive z is the west side of town.

## Street names

Hail and Hurst are the real names, spelled that way. Hail Street is named for John D. Hail of Macomb, one of the three men who laid the town out. The city still addresses City Hall at 138 East Hail Street. Hurst Street is the next street southwest of Hail. There is no Hale Street.

The other downtown streets used here, in the order they still stand, are:

- Southwest to northeast, crossing the tracks: Davis, Barnes, Hurst, Hail, Gridley, Wells. Twyman and Osborne continue farther northeast, outside this model.
- Northwest to southeast, parallel to the tracks: Washington, Jackson, Dean, West Main, the railroad ground, East Main, Crafford, Rile, Sperry. Cole Street is one street farther east.

Crafford is the spelling in the centennial history and on the modern street. The 1886 fire-insurance map is hard to read at that label, and a scan sometimes looks like Crawford. The model uses Crafford.

East Main and West Main are two streets, not one street cut in half. They are the two wide streets the plat put on either side of the railroad.

## The 1854 plat

The 1885 county history describes the original survey, and the same account is repeated in the centennial book.

- The town was laid out in 1854 on the northeast quarter of section 33, before the railroad was finished.
- John D. Hail sold a two-thirds interest to D. P. Wells and Iverson L. Twyman. County surveyor William H. Rile laid the town out under their direction.
- The streets were run parallel to the railroad, which crossed the quarter on a diagonal.
- The quarter was divided into 48 blocks of 12 lots. Each block was 360 feet square.
- Two streets parallel to the railroad, one on each side, were 70 feet wide. All other streets were 60 feet.
- The proprietors gave the town two blocks for parks, one east of the railroad and one west.
- The town was named for Nehemiah Bushnell, then president of the Northern Cross Railroad, which became the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy.

A 360-foot block plus a 60-foot street is 420 feet from the center of one street to the center of the next. Measuring today's streets (OpenStreetMap, 2026) gives that same spacing, about 128 meters, and the same 70-foot mains with a wide railroad reserve between them. The downtown grid is still the 1854 plat. The model uses those survey numbers, not a traced scan.

The twelve lots inside each block are drawn as six 60-foot lots facing each of the two parallel streets, with a mid-block alley. That is the ordinary split for a square block of twelve lots. The histories say there were twelve lots. They do not print the lot lines, so the split is inferred.

Which two blocks were the parks is also inferred. The business block of Hail Street, from East Main to Crafford, was called German row and was paved as a business street in 1900, so it was not the park. The National Hotel stood on Crafford opposite the East Park. The model puts the East Park on the Barnes–Hurst block between East Main and Crafford, and the West Park on the matching block west of the tracks. The trees are the soft maples Elias Beaver set in the parks. The bandstand is remembered in the centennial book and may be a little later than 1880.

## The railroads

The Northern Cross, later the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy, was already graded through the town site in 1854. It runs northeast–southwest, about 30 degrees east of north. In the model it is one main track with a short siding by the depot and the elevator. The histories do not give the 1880 track count. The 1886 Sanborn map shows a wide railroad ground between the two Main streets, wide enough for more than a single rail.

The Toledo, Peoria & Warsaw was surveyed through Bushnell in 1867. The city and its citizens subscribed to the stock. By 1885 the county history calls that line part of the Wabash. It is the east–west railroad, and it crosses the Burlington at a slant about one block southwest of Davis Street. That crossing is the same one still used by the Keokuk Junction Railway, which inherited the route. A 1914 postcard, discussed on the Towns and Nature blog, places the T. P. & W. depot south of the Burlington station and just west of West Main. The model puts it there, turned to sit beside the east–west track.

The Burlington depot in the model is the older wooden depot. The Northern Cross depot predated the Q. A newer CB&Q depot was built after 1900, and the old building was moved and reused as a freight house. So the 1880 station is the frame depot, not the later one. The Bushnell House was remembered as the hotel opposite the Q station.

People went down to the depot in the 1880s. J. M. Varner & Son kept a lunch room there. The little lunch building is shown, with a note that the 1885 history describes the business without pinning the year it opened.

Telegraph poles follow the Burlington. The line itself is certain for an 1880 main-line railroad. The pole spacing is inferred. Hitching posts, a watering trough, a town pump, and a few oil lamps are the ordinary street furniture of a town this size. The lamps are inferred. Wooden crossbucks mark the street crossings. The crossings are real. The exact sign design is inferred.

## Streets and sidewalks

The centennial history says the old board walks downtown were disappearing around 1900, when brick walks and the first pavement went in. A 1900 petition asked for pavement on German row (Hail Street from East Main to Crafford), on East Main from Ball's carriage shop to the Bank of Bushnell, and on West Main from Hail to Hurst. In 1880 the streets were still dirt, and the business streets had boardwalks. The model puts the walks on the store side of those streets.

## Buildings named in the records

These are `sourced` in the data file. The notes on each one say what is firm and what is only the lot.

- **Cole Building**, brick, corner of East Main and Hail. James Cole made the bricks in the 1860s. He was a merchant and, from 1878, a banker. By the mid-1880s he had closed the store to bank full time. The corner is from the centennial book.
- **Hendee Store**, brick, corner of Hurst and West Main, in the centennial book, which says it housed Hendee's store and the Chandler bank. The 1885 history says S. A. Hendee started on the east side of the railroad in 1860. Both are recorded. The model uses the corner the centennial names, and the notes say the 1860 site may have been across the tracks.
- **Hendee House**, built in the summer of 1871 by S. A. Hendee. In 1885 Boyington & Son kept it, and the history calls it the best hotel on the line from Galesburg to Quincy. It stood on West Main. The exact lot on that street is inferred. Later it was the Alexander.
- **Bushnell House**, another leading hotel, remembered as opposite the Q station. It is placed on East Main facing the depot. The side of the tracks is inferred from that phrase.
- **National Hotel**, built by the Negleys and later kept by A. Hess, on Crafford Street opposite the East Park.
- **St. Charles Hotel**, kept by L. H. Green on Hurst Street. The lot is inferred.
- **American House**, an early frame hotel on East Hurst. The lot is inferred.
- **Sorter House**, opposite the T. P. & W. station.
- **Farmers National Bank**, organized in 1871 out of the private bank of Chandler & Cummings, with Charles Wilson as president. It failed in 1885. A paving note puts the Bank of Bushnell on East Main. The Hail corner is inferred.
- **Zook & Johnson**, drugs, paints, oils, and wallpaper, from March 1876. They owned a brick store 20 by 60 feet and two stories. The size is used. Which bay on Main was theirs is not stated.
- **Masonic Hall.** T. J. Pickett Lodge No. 307 was chartered in 1859. By 1885 the lodge owned its building and met in a room 45 by 50 feet. The West Main door is inferred.
- **Hendee Elevator**, built in 1880, 42 by 66 feet, 27,000 bushels. A later photo shows an elevator across from the Hendee House. The siding location is inferred from that.
- **Depot Mill**, M. H. Hicks, by the railroad. **Excelsior Mill**, a steam flour mill built by Nevious Bros. It failed in the fall of 1884, so it was standing in 1880. The centennial book says it stood just west of the Depot Mill. The exact corners are inferred.
- **Bushnell Pump Company**, opened in 1872 by Nelson, LaTourette & Company. By 1885 it was a large frame works opposite the old Wabash depot, making wooden pumps, windmills, and croquet sets.
- **Roach Livery.** John Roach had kept a livery for about ten years by 1885, so a stable was here around 1880. The history puts it at West Main and First Street. No First Street survives on the plat, so the barn is shown at West Main near Barnes. The big 45-by-80 barn was built in 1885, just after this scene, and the model shows a slightly smaller stable.
- **Christian Church**, at the corner of Hurst and Dean, later the fire-house corner. Frame construction is inferred.
- **Furniture**, a little east of the Bushnell House. Miller & Krouser opened that trade in 1859. The neighboring door is inferred.
- **Stockton West** dealt in grain, wood, and coal. A yard and a small office are shown by the siding. The business is documented. The shed is inferred.

The Presbyterian and Methodist churches are in the model as congregations that existed, on inferred lots. The Presbyterian church stood near the Christian Church. A later Presbyterian building is on West Hurst. The 1876 high school was a two-story brick building on a stone foundation. The histories used here do not pin its lot, so it is not shown. The first school, in 1856, was on Sperry Street, block 57, and was already gone by 1860.

## What was filled in

The January 1886 Sanborn map, six years after the scene, shows continuous brick and frame storefronts along both Main streets, with offices and halls upstairs, an alley behind, dwellings on the next streets, and a grain elevator in the railroad ground. Sanborn colors are red for brick and yellow for frame. The sheets are three, and the lettering is very small. This pass uses the map for that pattern, not for a door-by-door copy of every label.

The store names along the rows, other than the ones listed above, are typical trades: grocery, dry goods, hardware, millinery, boots, bakery, harness, a wagon shop, a saloon, a barber. They are stand-ins. German row, Hail Street from East Main to Crafford, is filled the same way. The 1900 paving petition is what calls that block German row.

Houses are one frame house on most platted lots off the business streets, with about one lot in four left empty. The 1886 map shows dwellings there. No particular house is a documented home. About three quarters are one story. Most have a porch. Paint colors are the ordinary white, cream, yellow, gray, barn red, and green.

There is no Sanborn map from 1880 itself. The Library of Congress has Bushnell sheets for January 1886 (3 sheets), August 1893 (4), May 1898 (4), March 1906 (5), and 1912. The 1886 set is the one used. The 1871 Andreas, Lyter & Co. atlas of McDonough County has a hand-colored plat of Bushnell that shows the Toledo, Peoria & Western. A copy of that sheet could not be opened online for this pass, so the plat geometry comes from the 1885 written survey plus the streets that are still on the ground.

The town's population in the 1880 census was 2,316, up from 2,003 in 1870.
